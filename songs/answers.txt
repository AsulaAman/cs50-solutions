If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
I would calculate the average energy, danceability and valence of the listeners top 100 songs and then figure out their audio aura for example:
SELECT
AVG(energy)
AVG(danceability)
AVG(valence)
FROM songs;


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
calulating the raura for different genres?
It might not fully and accurately represent their actual listening experience, it does not take into account things like their order of preference
or listening frequency- the listener may have played a few songs many times compared to others. A better way might be to include genre and play count,
or even to group songs according to the mood categories and then analsye which groups are most dominant.
